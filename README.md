Github repo to present my steps to get a job at Google as Software Engineer.

I'm a Software Engineer (currently working as java contractor) with more than 15 years experience, based in UK (Gloucestershire), have 3 kids, a cat and a tortoise.

I will do my best to get the job before end of this year (2022).

To get the job at Google as a Software Engineer I have to be good at programming :).
Currently, I feel I have lost my programming skills just because I do very specific type of programming (I prefer not to tell what is it).
Anyway let's have a look at an example of a job spec from Google website:

Software Engineer, Fitbit

In-office:
London UK

Minimum qualifications:

Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, a related field, or equivalent practical experience.

Preferred qualifications:

I will split my learning into similar spaces as Google presents their required experience for their candidates.
