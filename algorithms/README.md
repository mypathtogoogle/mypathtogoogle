Algorithms

I feel I can understand and learn how to use them, actually every programmer can do it, but not everyone need them and want to discover them.
So please try to follow me and enjoy.

I will start with the book https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms and will use Java and Kotlin
(yes both languages, every algorithm will have 2 examples) to write algorithms as we go.
